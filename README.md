# Purgatory REDUX!

## Synopsis:
This is a simple RPG game using the Pygame library. 
It uses a turn-based system battle system, and a dialogue tree for each party memeber as well as an overworld that the user will be able to move around in and interact with.
Not only do I feel this will improve my coding skills, but I have also taken an interest to digital art. I will be making all the assets for this game, the pixel art, portraits, etc.
I’ve always wanted to explore more elements of RPG making, as one day I do plan on making an indie game of my own.


## Mechanics
### Dialogue System
Each main character will have a dialogue tree associated with them, leading to different changes in Jet’s morality stat. 
This stat will determine the ending.
The dialogue tree will have different conversations that happen based on what the player chooses. A tree can get progressively worse or better, depending on those choices. There will be a way to “hop” from the “bad” branch to the “good” branch. 
Each dialogue option can be binary, adding or subtracting from the overall morality stat, or perhaps even a third option in which the stat will stay the same.

### Turn-Based RPG System
A classical turn-based RPG. 
The original Purgatory program was based on the combat systems of Octopath Traveler and Persona 5. 
Jet and Chase would each get a turn and then each enemy would get a turn. A character can only be controlled by Jet if their relationship progresses enough in the dialogue trees mentioned above.
The order of play is dependent on a stat, much like in Octopath. So not all allies will go at the same time, and not all enemies will go at the same time, it is dependent on a stat. In the original program, this stat was called “speed,” in this iteration it will be called agility.
In the original program, there were different weapons you could use based on the class of the character you made. Your party members were predetermined but used unique weapons of their own. 
Chase by default will be a cleric,  and Jet a warrior-type, though these classes can be changed later using other game mechanics.
