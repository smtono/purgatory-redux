# Purgatory REDUX!

## Synopsis:
This is a simple RPG game using the Pygame library. This is to learn Python more thoroughly, though in a familiar way.
This is the next iteration of my previous text RPG game, Purgatory. That was written in Java and used the Swing toolkit.

It will use most of the same game mechanics, using a turn-based system, however there will be visuals to aid it also created by me. 
It will have a similar battle system, and a dialogue tree that I was planning in the previous game, as well as an overworld that the user will be able to move around in and interact with.

This game will be based off the first arc in my comic, Purgatory. 
Purgatory is set up as the main character, Jet, defeating demons based of the 7 deadly sins. This game will just cover the 1st demon in this sequence of events, and possibly I will make the transition to using the Unity engine to make a true game based off this concept, and once I get a better computer.
For now, I feel the Pygame library will suffice enough for what I want to do here.

Not only do I feel this will improve my coding skills, but I have also taken an interest to digital art.
Another goal I have, other than creating a code base using Python, is to improve my art skills, and even learn a new skill set, dealing with pixel art. 
I also would like to make animated portraits, if possible

Iâ€™ve always wanted to explore more elements of RPG making, as one day I do plan on making an indie game of my own. This project would be a step in the right direction, I think.

For now, I will focus on the first arc of the story I am wanting to tell
